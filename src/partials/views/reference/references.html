        The game was created by using the <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> game development engine which can be downloaded
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">here</a>. I made this game by following along with the tutorials found
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial" target="_blank">here</a>. All assets used in the tutorial can
        be found on the Unity Asset Store <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13866">here</a>. The page that the player opens in
        is not styled by me, but is built by Unity as a HTML page. No modifications have been made to the page since it was built.
