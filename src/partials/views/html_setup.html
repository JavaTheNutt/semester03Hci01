            <p>
                In order to begin designing webpages with HTML, no special tools are required. All you need is a text editor(such as Notepad)
                and a browser (such as Google Chrome).</p>

            <p> It may be difficult to write your HTML in Notepad but there are lots of free alternatives,
                such as <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.3.html" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> ,
                <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a> .
            </p>
            <p>
                For basic HTML design, any browser will work. I would recommend either
                <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla FireFox</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Once you have your text editor and browser installed, you're good to go!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                To test that everything is working correctly, copy the following text into your text editor and save it as index.html (Ensure that the dropdown menu is set to "all files" or html
                document).
            </p>
            <pre class="htmlExample">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br>&lthtml&gt<br>    &ltbody&gt<br>        &ltp&gtHello, World&ltp&gt<br>    &lt/body&gt<br>&lt/html&gt
            </pre>
            <p>
                Once you have the file saved, open it with a browser. If you typed it correctly, you should see the words "Hello, World!" printed at the top of the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you've designed your first website! Congratulations!!
